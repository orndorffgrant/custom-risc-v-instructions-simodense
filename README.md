# Custom RISC-V instructions in verilog using simodense

This project is based on https://github.com/pphilippos/simodense and a significant amount of code from that repo is vendored in here. I only authored the selection sort and MD5 instructions (and related benchmark modifications).

My contributions were implemented in Spring 2023 as part of a course project for my Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland.
